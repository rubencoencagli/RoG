# RoG
This package contains MatLab functions for training and inference of the Ratio of Gaussians (RoG) model.
An example file is provided to illustrate how to generate synthetic RoG data, estimate model paramenters, and perform inference of the latent normalization signal. 


The package is available from the webpage:
